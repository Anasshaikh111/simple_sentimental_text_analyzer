The Python script you provided performs sentiment analysis on the summary of an article from the web.
Here's a brief description of its steps:-

Imports Necessary Libraries:

nltk: Used to download the required tokenizers for text processing (though punkt_tab isn't necessary, it’s trying to download it).
TextBlob: A Python library for processing textual data, used here for sentiment analysis.
newspaper: Used to scrape and parse the article content from the provided URL.
Downloading and Parsing an Article:

The script uses the newspaper library to download and parse the article from the given URL.
Summarization:

After parsing, the article is summarized using the .nlp() method, and the summary is stored in the text variable.
Sentiment Analysis:

Using TextBlob, it analyzes the sentiment of the summary. The sentiment.polarity gives a score between -1 (negative) and 1 (positive).
Output:

The script prints both the summary of the article and its sentiment polarity.
Example output:

Summary: A brief summary of the article’s key points.
Sentiment: A float number indicating whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
